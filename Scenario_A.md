Scenario A

Hi John,

Thanks for reaching out. We understand that you want to be put on the advanced track however for us to give you the best experience we can only put you on the program that fits your need.

You can always apply again on the next semester. In the meantime, we urge you to take the intermediate track so you can get a better grasp on handling technical interviews.

Regards,
Patrick
