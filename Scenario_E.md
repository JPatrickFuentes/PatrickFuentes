Thanks for reaching out. I understand that you received an email about your application, and upon checking, I saw that your pre-work project is still missing, which we will need to complete your application.

The pre-work project consists of a few steps:

1.	Setup your Android environment
2.	Build initial todo app
3.	Submit todo app for review via Github
4.	Add edit functionality to the todo app
5.	Extend your todo app, improve UI, add features

Before you proceed, please check the full details of the pre-work project here. After completion, please submit your work [here]( https://apply.codepath.org/dashboard/).

Your first class session is scheduled on February 19th (Saturday). Please check your entire schedule and coursework deadlines [here]( https://courses.codepath.org/courses/android_university/pages/schedule).

You may also join our slack community so we can better help you with your pre-work project.
