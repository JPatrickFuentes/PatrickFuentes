Scenario B

Hi Jane,

We really appreciate the Flix app you've built for the application process. At the moment, our courses are specifically targeted at students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States. But know that we do have ambitions well beyond that and we already run programs in other countries such as Haiti. We are planning to expand to many more areas as well.

You can also sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) and we'll notify you as classes become available in your area powered by local organizers or through remote means.

In the meantime, there are a lot of resources out there for people interested in learning Android, and weâ€™ve done some work to make them more accessible. We have many online resources for learning Android including an extensive list of Android resources online.

We hope to be able to bring programs to your area soon and expand our audience for future programs. Thanks for your understanding, 

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
