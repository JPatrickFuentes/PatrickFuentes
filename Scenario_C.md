Scenario C

Hi Anne,

Thank you for your interest in our Summer Interview Prep Course. We are trying our best to make our courses available for everyone however, I regret to inform you that the class that you wanted to take is already full.
We understand how hard it is to apply for internship that’s why we created this [internship interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view).  We also have many [online resources](https://support.codepath.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-can-i-get-started-learning-android-development-online) for learning Android including an extensive [list](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Beginning-Android-Resources#beginning-android-resources) of Android resources online.

You can also sign up to our mailing list and we’ll inform you on future courses and virtual events that might interest you.
We hope that you’ll soon find the internship program for you.

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
